Together, we formed Dash with one goal: to provide the best radio platform in the world. This means all the variety you ever wanted with zero commercials… oh ya, all live 24/7, for free.  We work hard to provide the best radio experience in the world (seriously, there are live DJ’s in our studio right now 24/7) but please tell us what you want to hear, add, or change as we are constantly evolving. If you like what you hear and want to help us grow, tell your friends to join the evolution of radio.
