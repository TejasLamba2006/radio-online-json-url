Radio Tamworth is a community radio station in Tamworth, Staffordshire. Our name is Total Choice Radio and that is what we are able to offer! Unlike commercial radio we don't have set playlists or guidelines on when certain genres of music can be played. Our presenters have total choice over what they play and they produce their own shows. Therefore our output is as unique as our team; one show can be completely different to the next. Expect brand new and favourite pop hits, some rock, a measure of eighties and everything else in between! We are aimed at the young population of Tamworth and the surrounding area and we're a bit different there too....","Genre":"Community","Country":"United Kingdom","Language":"English","Source1":"http://streaming.radiotamworth.com:8080/live","Source2":"-","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Offshore Radio Sounds","Description":"The best from Offshore Radio in studio and medium wave quality","Genre":"Oldies","Country":"United Kingdom","Language":"English","Source1":"http://82.161.249.224:5580/;","Source2":"http://82.161.249.224:5580/listen.pls","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"2XS Rocks!","Description":"New Music, Live Sessions and 60 Years of Rock and Roll","Genre":"Rock","Country":"United Kingdom","Language":"English","Source1":"http://2xs.rocks/aac.m3u","Source2":"http://2xs.rocks/mp3.m3u","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Diva Radio - Disco","Description":"Disco Music Paradise","Genre":"70s/80s","Country":"United Kingdom","Language":"English","Source1":"http://deevaradio.net/divadisco/stream/divaradio_wa.m3u","Source2":"http://deevaradio.net/divadisco/stream/divaradio_its.pls","Source3":"http://deevaradio.net/divadisco/stream/divaradio_aac_its.pls","Source4":"http://deevaradio.net/divadisco/stream/divaradio_32_its.pls","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Sabras Radio 1260 AM","Description":"Sabras Radio is available on 1260AM in the whole of the East Midlands and parts of others including Birmingham, Coventry and as far south as Milton Keynes.","Genre":"Asian","Country":"United Kingdom","Language":"Hindi","Source1":"http://radio.canstream.co.uk:8025/live.mp3","Source2":"http://www.sabrasradio.com/res/wm_lo.m3u","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Free Radio 80s","Description":"http://www.freeradio.co.uk/80s/ Except during live sport.
