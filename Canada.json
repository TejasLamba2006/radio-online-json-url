The History of RadioXY The seeds were planted by the early 90's. I was addicted to radio, and dreamed of starting my own station. At the time (pre-Internet era for me:), I knew nothing of broadcasting on FM. But what kind of transmitters can anyone find? Yep, CB. But did I go to Radio Shack and get some cheapo transmitter off the shelf? Hell no! I went to some guy in the burbs who had mile-high grass growing in his yard - and a zillion wierd antennae sticking out from his roof! Walking into his house, I found radio equipment everywhere, stacked up on the floor. You had to walk between it all to get from room to room. He took me to his main room, where he had a 15-foot workbench with a permanent control board mounted to it. He let me play with his equipment for a bit, broadcasting on the shortwave bands.

Schumann's published compositions were written exclusively for the piano until 1840; he later composed works for piano and orchestra; many Lieder (songs for voice and piano); four symphonies; an opera; and other orchestral, choral, and chamber works. Works such as Kinderszenen, Album für die Jugend, Blumenstück, the Sonatas and Albumblätter are among his most famous. His writings about music appeared mostly in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik (New Journal for Music), a Leipzig-based publication which he jointly founded.

By the 16th century, harpsichord makers in Italy were making lightweight instruments with low string tension. A different approach was taken in Flanders starting in the late 16th century, notably by the Ruckers family. Their harpsichords used a heavier construction and produced a more powerful and distinctive tone. They included the first harpsichords with two keyboards, used for transposition. The Flemish instruments served as the model for 18th century harpsichord construction in other nations. In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument. Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the Blanchet family and Pascal Taskin, are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments.

The outstanding composer of the Middle Baroque period is the Englishman Henry Purcell, whose musical career provides a kind of compendium of the successive influences of national styles.

Strauss was also a prominent conductor throughout Germany and Austria.

Much of his piano music, chamber music, vocal music and orchestral music has entered the standard concert repertoire. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity from the performer, and his orchestral music, including Daphnis et Chloé and his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, use a variety of sound and instrumentation.

Antonio de Cabezón, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, and Girolamo Frescobaldi were three of the most important composers and teachers before 1650. Influenced by these composers, the North German school then rose to prominence with notable composers including Dieterich Buxtehude and especially Johann Sebastian Bach, considered by many to have achieved the height of organ composition. During this time, the French Classical school also flourished. After Bach, the organ's prominence gradually lost ground to the piano. Felix Mendelssohn, A.P.F. Boëly, and César Franck led a resurgence in the mid-19th century, leading a Romantic movement that would be carried further by Charles-Marie Widor, Louis Vierne, and others. In the 20th century, early-modernist Max Reger devoted a great deal of his compositional time to the organ; from small organ pieces to large-scale works such as the choral fantasias, Symphonic Fantasy and Fugue (Opus 57), Fantasy","Genre":"Classical","Country":"Canada","Language":"English","Source1":"http://proxy.calmradio.com:12928/;","Source2":"http://streams.calmradio.com:12928/;","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Calm Radio - Oratorios","Description":"An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piece—though oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics.

Born in humble circumstances, Mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism from Judaism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner and Mozart. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. https://www.facebook.com/calmradio/  https://twitter.com","Genre":"Classical","Country":"Canada","Language":"English","Source1":"http://proxy.calmradio.com:10428/;","Source2":"http://streams.calmradio.com:10428/;","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Calm Radio - Madrigals","Description":"A madrigal is a secular vocal music composition, usually a partsong, of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras. Traditionally, polyphonic madrigals are unaccompanied; the number of voices varies from two to eight, and most frequently from three to six. The madrigal reached its formal and historical zenith by the second half of the 16th century. English and German composers, too, took up the madrigal in its heyday. After the 1630s, the madrigal began to merge with the cantata and the dialogue. With the rise of opera in the early 17th century, the aria gradually displaced the madrigal.  https://www.facebook.com/calmradio/  https://twitter.com/calmradio  Welcome to Calm Radio!

Feeling constrained by Italian traditions and eager to experiment, he made an excursion to Paris with his friend Giovanni Battista Viotti, who presented him to Marie Antoinette and Parisian society. Cherubini received an important commission to write Démophon to a French libretto by Jean-François Marmontel that would be his first tragédie en musique.

The greatest legacy handed down by the Late Baroque period was its enormous wealth of operas (such as Handel's Serse) and oratorios, (two of the greatest being the St. Matthew Passion by J.S. Bach and Handel's magnificent Messiah). It is perhaps these two oratorios which most typify the sense of opulence and splendor associated with the period. Other major musical contributions of the Late Baroque era were various dance forms, such as the minuet, gigue, courante, allemande, and sarabande. These dances reflected movements that were ornamental, which was another key feature of this particular time in the history of music. The concerto grosso; the key instrumental form of the Late Baroque period, reflected the contrast between two groups of instruments: One was a small body of string soloists, known as the concertino, concertato, or concertante; the other group, known as the ripieno, formed the larger string section.

He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time. It was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. He was almost 50 before he embarked on the operatic career on which his reputation chiefly rests today. His debut, Hippolyte et Aricie (1733), caused a great stir and was fiercely attacked for its revolutionary use of harmony by the supporters of Lully's style of music. Rameau's music had gone out of fashion by the end of the 18th century. Today, he enjoys renewed appreciation with performances and recordings of his music ever more frequent. https://www.facebook.com/calmradio/  https://twitt","Genre":"Classical","Country":"Canada","Language":"English","Source1":"http://proxy.calmradio.com:14928/;","Source2":"http://streams.calmradio.com:14928/;","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Calm Radio - Jazz Guitar","Description":"A new and vintage collection of jazz guitar heroes, like Joe Pass, Herb Ellis, Charlie Byrd, Kenny Burrell and many more https://www.facebook.com/calmradio/  https://twitter.com/calmradio  Welcome to Calm Radio!

After graduating from an organ school in Prague, he began writing his first composition at the age of 20. In the 1860s, he played as a violist in the Bohemian Provisional Theater Orchestra. In 1873, he married Anna Čermáková, and left the orchestra to pursue another career as a church organist. Dvořák's music attracted the interest of Johannes Brahms, who assisted his career. https://www.facebook.com/calmradio/  https://twitter.com/calmradio  Welcome to Calm Radio!

It was in regular use in Europe up until the end of the 18th century. The baryton differs from the bass viol in having an additional set of wire strings. These perform two functions: they vibrate sympathetically with the bowed strings, enriching the tone, and they can also be plucked by the left thumb of the performer, creating a contrasting tonal quality. As can be seen in the illustration, the bowed strings are placed on the right, where they can be easily fingered by the player's left hand. The plucked strings are on the left; they were reachable by the player's thumb from the rear, where the back of the instrument's neck was left open. Of the repertoire for this instrument, the best known works are the 175 compositions written by Joseph Haydn for his patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterházy, who enjoyed playing this instrument.

After a period influenced by Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky, Shostakovich developed a hybrid style, as exemplified by Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (1934). This single work juxtaposed a wide variety of trends, including the neo-classical style (showing the influence of Stravinsky) and post-Romanticism (after Gustav Mahler). Sharp contrasts and elements of the grotesque characterize much of his music. Shostakovich's orchestral works include 15 symphonies and six concerti. His chamber output includes 15 string quartets, a piano quintet, two piano trios, and two pieces for string octet. His piano works include two solo sonatas, an early set of preludes, and a later set of 24 preludes and fugues. Other works include three operas, several song cycles, ballets, and a substantial quantity of film music. https://www.facebook.com/calmradio/  https:/","Genre":"Classical","Country":"Canada","Language":"English","Source1":"http://streams.calmradio.com:12528/;","Source2":"http://proxy.calmradio.com:12528/;","Source3":"-","Source4":"-","Source5":"-","Source6":"-"},{"Title":"Calm Radio - Domenico Scarlatti","Description":"Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (26 October 1685 – 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer who spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families.

Although they overlap in time, they are conventionally dated from 1580 to 1630, from 1630 to 1680, and from 1680 to 1730. The English word baroque is derived from the Italian barocco, meaning bizarre, though probably exuberant would be a better translation more accurately reflecting the sense. The usage of this term originated in the 1860s to describe the highly decorated style of 17th and 18th century religious and public buildings in Italy, Germany and Austria. Later, during the early-to-mid 1900s, the term baroque was applied by association to music of the 17th and early 18th century, and today the term baroque has come to refer to a very clearly definable type or genre of music which originated, broadly speaking, around 1600 and came to fruition between 1700 and 1750. https://www.facebook.com/calmradio/  https://twitter.com/calmradio  Welcome to Calm Radio!
